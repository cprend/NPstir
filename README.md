# NPstir
This repository contains the code for a nutrient-phytoplankton model coupled to a 2-D stirring flow, equations and details of the model setup are given in Prend et al. (submitted). The model is run using the NPstir.m script, which calls 3 functions (diffuse.m, psi1.m, upw.m). Altering the model domain, parameters, form of the reaction terms, etc can all be done in the NPstir.m script.
